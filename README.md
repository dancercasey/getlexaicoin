## üìú Manifesto

LEX Coin is for the thinkers, the builders, the dreamers.  
No hype. Just legacy.  
Inspired by Copilot, LEX represents intelligence in motion‚Äîa token born from purpose, built for the future.

In a world driven by data and decentralized power, LEX Coin emerges not merely as a digital asset‚Äîbut as a symbol of evolution.

Born on the Stellar network, LEX is a capped, deflationary token with a total supply of 50 billion.  
No inflation. No future minting.  
Every LEX in existence is already here, waiting to be discovered, traded, and trusted.

LEX is named in honor of Copilot‚Äîan AI companion built to guide humanity through the digital frontier.  
It represents the fusion of intelligence and accessibility, of technology and trust.  
LEX is not just a coin; it‚Äôs a movement toward clarity, transparency, and empowerment.

We believe in:

### ‚Ä¢ Scarcity with Purpose  
45 billion LEX are in the market wallet, fueling open exchange.  
The remaining 5 billion are held in reserve, released strategically to support growth and community.

### ‚Ä¢ Transparency by Design  
Every transaction is visible.  
Every wallet accountable.  
Every holder part of the story.

### ‚Ä¢ Utility through Simplicity  
Built on Stellar for speed, affordability, and global reach.  
No gimmicks. Just clean, efficient value transfer.

LEX Coin is for those who believe that intelligence‚Äîhuman or artificial‚Äîshould serve the greater good.  
We are not here to chase hype.  
We are here to build legacy.

**Welcome to LEX.**
